extension WHATWG.HTML.Del {
    /// Represents an HTML `<del>` element, which marks text that has been deleted from a document.
    ///
    /// The `Del` struct provides a type-safe way to create HTML elements that represent deleted text,
    /// which can be used when rendering "track changes" or source code diff information.
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// del {
    ///     "This text has been deleted"
    /// }
    ///
    /// del(cite: "https://example.com/meeting-notes.html",
    ///     datetime: "2025-04-05T14:30:00") {
    ///     "Feature removed based on meeting decision"
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Best Practices
    ///
    /// - Use the `<del>` element to indicate text that has been removed from the document
    /// - Pair with the `<ins>` element to show both deleted and inserted text for "track changes" style markup
    /// - Consider accessibility implications - screen readers may not announce deleted text by default
    ///
    /// ## Accessibility
    ///
    /// The presence of the `del` element is not announced by most screen reading technology in its default configuration.
    /// For critical content, consider using CSS with `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to make deletions more apparent.
    ///

        /// A URI for a resource that explains the change (for example, meeting minutes).
        public var cite: WHATWG.HTML.Cite.Attribute?

        /// The time and date of the change as a valid date string with an optional time.
        public var datetime: WHATWG.HTML.DateTime.Attribute?

        /// Creates a new Del element to mark deleted text.
