public import WHATWG_HTML_GlobalAttributes
public import WHATWG_HTML_Shared

/// Represents an HTML `<ins>` element, which marks text that has been added to a document.
///
/// The `InsertedText` struct provides a type-safe way to create HTML inserted text elements with various attributes.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// ins {
///     "This text has been inserted"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ```swift
/// ins(cite: "changes.html", datetime: "2025-04-05T12:00:00Z") {
///     "This text was added on April 5th, 2025"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Accessibility Considerations
///
/// - The presence of the `<ins>` element is not announced by most screen reading technology in its default configuration.
/// - It can be made to be announced by using the CSS `content` property, along with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements.
/// - Only use this when it's important for users to know that content was inserted.
///
