/// Represents an HTML details element (`<details>`), which creates a disclosure widget in which
/// information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an open state.
///
/// The `Details` struct provides a type-safe way to create disclosure widgets with customizable content.
/// A summary or label should be provided using the `<summary>` element as the first child.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// details {
///     summary {
///         "System Requirements"
///     }
///     p {
///         "Requires a computer running an operating system. The computer must have some memory and ideally some kind of long-term storage."
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Multiple Named Disclosure Boxes
///
/// ```swift
/// details(name: "reqs") {
///     summary {
///         "Graduation Requirements"
///     }
///     p {
///         "Requires 40 credits, including a passing grade in health, geography, history, economics, and wood shop."
///     }
/// }
/// details(name: "reqs") {
///     summary {
///         "System Requirements"
///     }
///     p {
///         "Requires a computer running an operating system."
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Best Practices
///
/// - Use the `open` attribute to control the initial state of the disclosure widget
/// - Always include a `<summary>` element as the first child to provide a label
/// - The `name` attribute allows multiple details elements to be connected in an accordion-like pattern
/// - Use CSS to style the disclosure widget for better visual appearance
///
