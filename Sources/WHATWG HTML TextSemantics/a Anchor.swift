/// Represents an HTML anchor element (`<a>`), which creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email
/// addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.
///
/// The `Anchor` struct provides a type-safe way to create HTML hyperlinks with various attributes
/// that control the link's behavior and appearance. Content within each anchor should indicate
/// the link's destination.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// anchor(
///     href: "https://example.com",
///     target: .blank,
///     rel: "noopener noreferrer"
/// ) {
///     "Visit Example Website"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Examples for Common Uses
///
/// Email links:
/// ```swift
/// anchor(href: "mailto:contact@example.com") {
///     "Email Us"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Telephone links:
/// ```swift
/// anchor(href: "tel:+15555555555") {
///     "Call Us: (555) 555-5555"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In-page navigation:
/// ```swift
/// anchor(href: "#section-id") {
///     "Jump to Section"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Best Practices
///
/// - Use descriptive link text that indicates where the link leads
/// - Avoid generic text like "click here" or "read more"
/// - When opening links in new tabs, use `rel="noopener"` for security
/// - Consider providing visual indicators for links that download files or open in new tabs
/// - Use the appropriate URL scheme based on the link's purpose (e.g., `mailto:` for email addresses)
/// - For improved accessibility, make interactive links at least 44×44 CSS pixels in size
/// - Ensure adequate spacing between links placed in close proximity to avoid accidental activation
///
/// - Note: When rendered, this generates an HTML `<a>` element with the appropriate
///   attributes based on the link configuration.

    /// Indicates that Attribution-Reporting-Eligible header should be sent.
    ///
    /// Used to register a navigation-based attribution source for the Attribution Reporting API.

    ///
    /// - Note: Still experimental as of 2025
    public var attributionsrc: AttributionSrc?

    /// Causes the browser to treat the linked URL as a download.
    ///
    /// This attribute can be used with or without a filename value:
    ///
    /// - Without a value: The browser will suggest a filename/extension, generated from various sources:
    ///   - The Content-Disposition HTTP header
    ///   - The final segment in the URL path
    ///   - The media type (from the Content-Type header, data: URL, or Blob.type)
    ///
    /// - With a filename value: Suggests a filename for the downloaded file.
    ///   Characters like `/` and `\` are converted to underscores (`_`).
    ///   Browsers will adjust the suggested name if it contains characters forbidden by the filesystem.
    ///
    /// ## Limitations
    ///
    /// - Only works for same-origin URLs, or the `blob:` and `data:` schemes.
    /// - Browser handling varies by browser, user settings, and other factors.
    /// - The user may be prompted before a download starts, or the file may be saved automatically,
    ///   or opened in an external application or the browser itself.
    ///
    /// ## Content-Disposition Header Interaction
    ///
    /// If the Content-Disposition header has different information from the download attribute:
    /// - If the header specifies a filename, it takes priority over a filename specified in this attribute.
    /// - If the header specifies a disposition of inline, modern browsers prioritize
    ///   this attribute and treat it as a download.

    /// - `mailto:` for email addresses
    /// - `tel:` for telephone numbers
    /// - `sms:` for text messages
    /// - Document fragments starting with `#` for in-page navigation

    /// - `nofollow` - Indicates search engines should not follow the link
    /// - `noopener` - Prevents the opened page from accessing the window.opener property
    /// - `noreferrer` - Prevents passing the referrer information to the linked page

    /// - `_blank` - New tab/window
    /// - `_parent` - Parent browsing context
    /// - `_top` - Topmost browsing context
    /// - `_unfencedTop` - Allows embedded fenced frames to navigate the top-level frame
