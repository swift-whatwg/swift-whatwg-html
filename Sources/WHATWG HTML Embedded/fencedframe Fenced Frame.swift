// Defines the fenced frame element (<fencedframe>)

public import WHATWG_HTML_MediaAttributes
public import WHATWG_HTML_Shared

/// Represents an HTML fencedframe element (`<fencedframe>`), which embeds another HTML page within a privacy-preserving container.
///
/// The `FencedFrame` element is similar to an iframe but with enhanced privacy features:
/// - Communication is restricted between the fencedframe content and its embedding site
/// - A fencedframe can access cross-site data only in controlled circumstances that preserve user privacy
/// - It cannot be manipulated via regular scripting
/// - Content can only be embedded via specific APIs like Protected Audience or Shared Storage
/// - Neither the fencedframe nor embedding context can access each other's DOM
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// fencedframe(
///     width: 640,
///     height: 320
/// ) {
///     // Content determined by API-generated config
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Accessibility
///
/// Use the `title` global attribute to provide a description of the embedded content for assistive technologies.
/// Without this label, users of screen readers would need to navigate into the fencedframe to understand its content.
///
